# DebianDC Networking Architecture

This document describes how network configuration is handled in DebianDC, with a particular focus on static IP assignment and DNS stability.
DebianDC does not aim to provide a flexible, user-oriented networking stack. Instead, it focuses on predictable behavior suitable for Samba Active Directory, Kerberos authentication, and infrastructure services.
