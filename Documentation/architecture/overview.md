# What is DebianDC?

DebianDC is a **customized system and toolset** developed on top of Debian GNU/Linux
with the purpose of **deploying, managing, and operating Samba Active Directory (AD) environments**.

The project aims to manage the Samba AD infrastructure in a more
**controlled, transparent, and sustainable** manner,
both during the **initial deployment phase** and throughout the **operational lifecycle**.

Rather than being a general-purpose desktop Linux distribution,
DebianDC is designed as a **focused infrastructure component for enterprise directory services**.

## Project Purpose

The primary goal of DebianDC is to simplify the lifecycle management of
Samba Active Directory environments and to provide system administrators with a
**clear and transparent control surface**.

Within this scope, DebianDC:

- Provides automated and repeatable installation processes
- Simplifies the deployment of Samba Active Directory Domain Controllers
- Eases the management of DNS, Kerberos, and related AD components
- Supports daily administration and auditing tasks with
  lightweight graphical tools
- Aims for script-based, traceable, and auditable operations
