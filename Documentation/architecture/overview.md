# What is DebianDC?

DebianDC is a **customized system and toolset** developed on top of Debian GNU/Linux
with the purpose of **deploying, managing, and operating Samba Active Directory (AD) environments**.

The project aims to manage the Samba AD infrastructure in a more
**controlled, transparent, and sustainable** manner,
both during the **initial deployment phase** and throughout the **operational lifecycle**.

Rather than being a general-purpose desktop Linux distribution,
DebianDC is designed as a **focused infrastructure component for enterprise directory services**.
