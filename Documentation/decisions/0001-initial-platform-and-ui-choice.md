## Status
Accepted (historical record)

## Context

When the DebianDC project was first initiated, the primary objective was to build a **lightweight, script-based, and controllable** system for deploying and managing Samba Active Directory environments.

During the early stages of the project, the following goals were prioritized:

- Making the installation process as automated as possible
- Solving graphical interface requirements
  using simple and lightweight tools
- Ensuring the system remains easy to understand
  and straightforward to intervene in when needed
