# ADR-0002: Decision to Transition to Debian 13 and Openbox

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The initial versions of the DebianDC project were developed using the Debian 11 (Bullseye) base and the LXDE desktop environment.

As the project evolved:
- The number and scope of tools increased
- More scripts and supporting components were added for Samba Active Directory management
- Long-term maintenance, release upgrades, and package lifecycle considerations became more prominent

At this stage, the platform and desktop environment were re-evaluated to ensure the long-term sustainability of DebianDC.
